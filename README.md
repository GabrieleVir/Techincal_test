# PHP test

## 1. Installation

  - Go on the root of the project and use the command "composer install" then "composer update"
  - Create a database-config.php inside the config folder using the database-config-template.php as reference.
  - you can test the demo script in your shell: "php index.php"

## 2. Expectations

This simple application works, but with very old-style monolithic codebase, so do anything you want with it, to make it:

  - easier to work with
  - more maintainable
