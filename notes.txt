The types are not defined, is not a must but it is good to specify for reducing the interpretation.
There are no namespaces for the classes.
Vendors names are not specific enough.
No comments on the methods.
Need to create folders Entity and Repository.

DB.php
Sensitive datas are directly on the db.php file.
The variables names are not specific enough.
I prefer to use a ORM manager like doctrine. More safe and scalable.
The class name is not specific enough and doesn't respect psr-1: Class names MUST be declared in StudlyCaps.

CommentManager.php
This file is causing side effects (including files with the constructor) and declaring new symbols (The class + the methods). A file should not do both.
Not enough comments to explain this class.
This should extend comment

NewsManager.php
This file is causing side effects (including files with the constructor) and declaring new symbols (The class + the methods). A file should not do both.
Foreign keys in comments should delete on cascade. No method needed for finding and deleting all the comments linked to the news.
This should extend news

index.php
The applications constants should be placed in a separate configuration file that should be ignored by git (can also contains also the db credentials).
There is no git in this project.

sql
The charset should be utf-8.
Varchar shouldn't be random numbers.

Comment.php
No comments.
The class variables should be private. That's why the getId exists.
setId should not exist

News.php
Same issues than Comment.php
