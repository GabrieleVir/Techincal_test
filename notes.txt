The types are not defined, is not a must but it is good to specify for reducing the interpretation.
There are no namespaces for the classes.
Vendors names doesn't are not specific enough.
No comments on the methods.

DB.php
Sensitive datas are directly on the db.php file.
The variables names are not specific enough.
I prefer to use a ORM manager like doctrine. More safe and scalable.
The class name is not specific enough and doesn't respect psr-1: Class names MUST be declared in StudlyCaps.

CommentManager.php
This file is causing side effects (including files with the constructor) and declaring new symbols (The class + the methods). A file should not do both.
Not enough comments to explain this class.

NewsManager.php
This file is causing side effects (including files with the constructor) and declaring new symbols (The class + the methods). A file should not do both.
Foreign keys in comments should delete on cascade. No method needed for finding and deleting all the comments linked to the news.

The applications constants should be placed in a separate configuration file that should be ignored by git (can also contains also the db credentials).
There is no git in this project.

sql
The charset should be utf-8.
Varchar shouldn't be random numbers.
